This is the C implementation of a bloom filter.

Two scripts that run the application have been written:
  1. main.sh compiles and runs the demonstration application.
  2. testscript.sh compiles and runs the testing application which measures time and memory consumption.
     It expects the test files are located  in the folder above the folder the script has been executed.
  
To run a script simply execute "bash scriptname.sh" in terminal.
